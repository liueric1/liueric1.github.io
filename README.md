# Personal Website Template

This is a clean, accessible template for a personal site with the following sections:

- About
- Experience
- Projects
- Contact

## Structure

```
liueric1.github.io/
  index.html
  styles/
    main.css
  scripts/
    main.js
  assets/
    images/
    fonts/
```

## Customize

- Open `index.html` and replace placeholder text ("Your Name", email, links).
- Add your projects inside the `#projects` section as additional `.project-card`s.
- Put images in `assets/images` and reference them in your markup.
- Adjust styles in `styles/main.css` (colors, spacing, layout).

## Development tips

- This site is static and can be hosted on GitHub Pages.
- Consider using a favicon: place it under `assets/images` and add a `<link rel="icon" href="assets/images/favicon.png">` in `index.html`.
- The stylesheet adapts to system dark/light mode using `prefers-color-scheme`.
